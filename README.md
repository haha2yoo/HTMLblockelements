# _My first webpage - using HTML_

#### _Using HTML and practicing README with the guidance of Epicodus, August 20, 2019_

#### By _**Helen Y**_

## Description

_{Using HTML elements in creating my first webpage, and now practicng my first README as well. This website is sharing teh information about my first steps (ever) into coding, and information about Epicodus.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _1. Check out the webpage_
* _2. Check out the links on the site_
* _3. Leave feedback on how it could be approved_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{No known bugs yet. Had difficulty uploading to git from command line after initial push. Will be working through that during the next class.}_

## Support and contact details

_{If you have any questions or comments, especially on how I can improve my coding, please feel free to leave a comment or shoot me a message.}_

## Technologies Used

_{Used HTML for the webpage, block and inline elements. And also using Markdown for the README.}_
